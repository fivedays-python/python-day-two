## **Day 2: Control Structures, Functions, and Data Collections**

### **Agenda**

Welcome to Day 2! Today, we'll delve into control structures, functions, and data collections. By the end of this session, you'll be able to make your programs make decisions, perform repetitive tasks efficiently, encapsulate code into reusable functions, and handle collections of data.

### **Schedule**

1. **Conditional Statements**
   - Understanding `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
   - Nested conditions.
   - Logical operators.

2. **Loops**
   - `for` loops.
   - `while` loops.
   - Loop control statements (`break`, `continue`, `pass`).

3. **Functions**
   - Defining and calling functions.
   - Parameters and arguments.
   - Return statements.
   - Variable scope (local vs. global).

4. **Data Collections**
   - Lists.
   - Tuples.
   - Dictionaries.
   - Sets.

5. **Hands-On Activities**
   - **Exercise 1:** Prime Number Checker.
   - **Exercise 2:** To-Do List Application.
   - **Exercise 3:** Word Frequency Counter.
