# Day 2 Agenda: Control Structures and Data Collections

Welcome to Day 2 of our 5-day Python course! Today, we'll build upon the fundamentals we learned yesterday and dive into control structures and data collections. This session is designed to introduce you to conditional statements, loops, and Python's built-in data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.

## Schedule

### **1. Conditional Statements**
- **Topics:**
  - Understanding `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.
  - Nested conditions.
  - Real-world examples of decision-making in code.

### **2. Loops**
- **Topics:**
  - **For Loops:**
    - Iterating over sequences (lists, strings, etc.).
    - Using the `range()` function.
  - **While Loops:**
    - Executing code while a condition is true.
    - Avoiding infinite loops.
  - **Loop Control Statements:**
    - `break` to exit a loop.
    - `continue` to skip an iteration.
    - `pass` as a null operation.

### **3. Data Collections**
- **Topics:**
  - **Lists:**
    - Creating lists.
    - Indexing and slicing.
    - Common methods: `append()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `sort()`.
  - **Tuples:**
    - Immutable sequences.
    - Tuple packing and unpacking.
  - **Dictionaries:**
    - Key-value pairs.
    - Accessing, adding, and removing items.
    - Iterating over dictionaries.
  - **Sets:**
    - Unordered collections of unique elements.
    - Set operations: union, intersection, difference.

### **4. Hands-On Activity: Prime Number Checker**
- **Objective:**
  - Write a program that checks if a number entered by the user is a prime number.
  - Apply control structures and loops to solve the problem.

### **5. Wrap-Up and Q&A**
- **Topics:**
  - Recap of key concepts learned.
  - Open session for questions and clarifications.

## Materials Needed
- **Coding Platform:** Access to [Replit](https://replit.com/) for online coding.
- **No prior setup required** as we'll be coding directly in the browser.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of today's session, you should be able to:

- Understand and use conditional statements to control the flow of a program.
- Implement loops (`for` and `while`) to execute code repeatedly.
- Utilize Python's built-in data collections: lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
- Apply control structures and data collections to solve practical problems.
- Write more complex programs that make decisions and handle collections of data.
